# Advent of Code - 2021

My solutions and answers for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about). 

I decided to use a simple CLI [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) app for each puzzle.

You can run each solution with `node` and the path to the JS file you want to run. Eg: `node day1/part2.js` will print the solution for the Day 1, Part 2 puzzle using `input.txt`. 

You can provide your own input data as a text file as part of executing a JS file. For example, I created a `test-input.txt` file that contains the example data given in the puzzle like so: `node day1/part2.js test-input.txt`.
